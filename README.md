# Image-Classification

Created a Jupyter notebook (CNN - Master Copy) which introduces the theory behind the working of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to builda users understanding of neural networks and deep learning. Also contains the step by step code to build a CNN model that can successfully classify images based on image content into a fixed number of categories.
